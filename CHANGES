Version 2.0 - September 5th, 2003

	* Version increase.
	* Added gzip support (with the tryGzip option), for reading of stanzas, so that compresses control files can be parsed on the fly
	* Added gzip support for writing of control files
	* Added parse_web to snag files right off the web. Useful for things such as apt's Sources.gz and Packages.gz

Version 1.10b - September 2nd, 2003

	*  Documentation fix for ## vs # in stripComments

Version 1.10 - September 2nd, 2003

Version 1.9 - July 24th, 2003

	* Fix for warning for edge case (uninitialized value in chomp)
	* Tests for CRLF

Version 1.8 - July 14th, 2003
	
	* By default, we now strip off whitespace unless verbMultiLine is in place.  This makes sense for things like conf files where trailing whitespace has no real meaning. Thanks to pudge, who reported this.

	* POD documentation error noticed again by Frank Lichtenheld

	* Slightly expanded test suite to cover new features

	* Removed exports as they were unnecessary. Many thanks to pudge, who pointed this out.
